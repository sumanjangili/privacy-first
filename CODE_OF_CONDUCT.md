# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
project and community a harassment‑free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and
expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We commit to:

* **Be respectful** – treat others with courtesy and empathy.
* **Be inclusive** – welcome people of all backgrounds and skill levels.
* **Be considerate** – recognize that our words and actions affect others.
* **Be collaborative** – focus on improving the project, not on personal attacks.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language.
* Being patient when answering questions.
* Respecting differing viewpoints and acknowledging that there is more than one
  correct way to solve a problem.
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

* Harassment, intimidation, or threats of violence.
* Discriminatory remarks or jokes based on protected characteristics.
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
* Personal insults, trolling, or demeaning language.
* Publishing private information (doxxing) without consent.
* Any conduct that makes others feel unsafe or unwelcome.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project maintainers at **contact@sumanjangili.com**.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Maintainers are empowered to:

* Warn the offending party.
* Temporarily suspend or permanently ban contributors from the project.
* Remove or edit offending content.

We reserve the right to take any other action we deem appropriate, including
reporting to law enforcement when necessary.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within the project’s public spaces
(e.g., GitHub issues, pull requests, mailing lists, chat rooms) and
any external venues where the project’s community interacts (e.g., conferences,
social media).
